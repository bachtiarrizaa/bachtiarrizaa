# Hi there 👋, I'm Bachtiar Riza Pratama

## 👋 Introduction

Hi, I’m **Bachtiar Riza Pratama** — a **Backend Developer** with a strong foundation in web development and a growing focus on **Fullstack and DevOps**. I enjoy designing backend systems, building scalable APIs, and connecting them with modern frontend applications. I prefer learning by building real projects and understanding how things work under the hood.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **fresh graduate** and currently working as a **Backend Developer Intern at GeekGarden**. My main focus is developing and maintaining backend services using **Laravel** and **Node.js** (Express & NestJS). On the frontend side, I work with **React** to build clean and functional user interfaces.

My long-term goal is to grow as a **Fullstack Engineer** with solid **DevOps fundamentals**, starting from a strong backend background. I enjoy working on structured systems, clean code, and continuously improving my technical depth.

Fun fact: I recently switched to **Linux**, love exploring and configuring my development environment, enjoy solving problems independently, and I’m a **coffee enthusiast** ☕.
